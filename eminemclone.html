<h1>Eminem on new album 'Kamikaze': I'm a little more happy when I’m angry</h1>

<p> Eminem insists that much of the negative response to his "Revival" album "went beyond constructive criticism" — but it fueled him to create the surprise record he dropped two weeks ago.</p>

<p>“I’m not gonna lie, there's something inside me that is a little more happy when I’m angry," he tells Sway Calloway in a just-released YouTube interview. "As bad as it feels to be there, there’s a rush of it that I like because it inspires me to say something back.”</p>

<p>In his first interview since the unannounced Aug. 31 release of "Kamikaze," the Detroit rapper addresses the barrage of critiques fired at last December's "Revival," a personal, reflective album full of pop guests.</p>

<p>The interview clip that hit Tuesday night is billed as "Part 1" of a discussion with Sway, a longtime rap journalist and host on Em's Shade 45 channel on SiriusXM. It closes with a teaser to a follow-up video where Em will address his beef with rapper Machine Gun Kelly.</p>

<p>"My man better chill," Eminem says of his reaction as MGK went after daughter Hailie.</p>
